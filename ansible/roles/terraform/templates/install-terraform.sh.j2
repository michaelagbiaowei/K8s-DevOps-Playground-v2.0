#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Step 1:
# This command retrieves the HashiCorp GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key from the specified URL
# and saves it as /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg. 
# The keyring file will be used to verify the authenticity of HashiCorp's software packages.
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

# Step 2:
# This command adds a new software repository configuration for HashiCorp products to your system.
# It specifies the repository URL with [signed-by] pointing to the GPG keyring file we downloaded earlier.
# $(lsb_release -cs) dynamically inserts your Linux distribution's codename into the URL.
# The resulting configuration is saved in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list file.
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

# Step 3:
# These commands update the local package database and install the Terraform package.
# 'sudo apt update' refreshes the list of available software packages.
# 'sudo apt install terraform' installs the Terraform tool if it's available in the newly added HashiCorp repository.
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
